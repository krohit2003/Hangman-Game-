# Hangman Game Algorithm

This repository contains the solution to a Hangman game challenge. The objective was to design a Hangman-playing algorithm with an accuracy rate exceeding 50%.

## Project Overview

The Hangman game is a word-guessing game where players try to identify a hidden word by guessing individual letters. This project implements a statistically-driven approach to predict letters in the word, leveraging probabilistic models and n-gram patterns for effective guessing.

## Methodology

### Intuition and Approach

The algorithm predicts letters based on patterns in English words:
- **Pattern-Based Guessing**: Utilizes common letter combinations (e.g., "TION," "MENT") and n-grams.
- **Conditional Probabilities**: Assigns probabilities to letters in specific contexts to prioritize likely guesses.
- **N-Grams**: Uses sequences from 1-grams up to 5-grams, focusing on patterns with 1 or 2 blank spaces for optimal accuracy.

### Steps in the Algorithm

1. **Initialization**: Represent the target word with blanks and add dummy markers for boundaries.
2. **Guessing Letters**: Using previously guessed letters, update the pattern and identify new probable letters.
3. **Pattern Breakdown**: Decompose the word into various n-gram patterns to analyze conditional probabilities.
4. **Weight Calculation**: Calculate scores for each letter based on precomputed frequencies of patterns.
5. **Letter Selection**: Choose the letter with the highest score, integrating it into the word pattern.
6. **Iteration**: Repeat the process until the word is completed or maximum incorrect guesses are reached.

### Precomputed Frequencies

To streamline computation, frequencies of each n-gram pattern in the dictionary were precomputed using `build_freq_tables()`, enabling rapid probability calculations.

## Function Descriptions

- **`guess(word)`**: Main function to determine the most likely letter.
- **`find_score(word, ngram)`**: Breaks down patterns and calculates letter probabilities.
- **`Conditional_Prob1(pat)` / `Conditional_Prob2(pat)`**: Calculates probability mass functions for patterns with one or two blank spaces.
- **`normalize1(pat)` / `normalize2(pat)`**: Normalizes frequencies to probabilities.
- **`build_freq_tables()`**: Builds frequency tables for patterns in the dictionary for constant-time access.

## Results

The final model achieved an accuracy rate of 66.5%, exceeding the required 50% threshold. This improvement demonstrates the effectiveness of using statistical analysis and linguistic patterns for predicting letters in the Hangman game.

## Conclusion

This Hangman algorithm significantly enhances accuracy through conditional probabilities and pattern recognition, providing a robust solution to the challenge.
